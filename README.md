# Introduction to Data Types and Operators  


## Operators
### Arithmetic Operators  
  ***These can be used to perform mathmatical operations on ints, floats and longs.***
* Addition  
  `print(a+b)`
* Subtraction  
  `print(a-b)`
* Division  
  `print(a/b)`
* Multiplication  
  `print(a*b)`
* Modulus  
  `print(a%b)`  

### Comparison Operators  
  ***These can be used to compare two more values and return a boolean.***  
* Equal to  
  `print(a==b)`  
* Not Equal to  
  `print(a!=b)`  
* Greater than  
  `print(a>b)`  
* Less than  
  `print(a<b)`  
* Greater than or Equal to  
  `print(a>=b)`  
* Less than or Equal to  
  `print(a<=b)`  
  
## Strings and Casting  
### Single or double quotes?  
  ***Both single quotes and double quotes can be used to define a string, which one is used is often defined***  
  ***by the specific situation and the developer's preference.***  
* Single quotes  
  `greeting = 'Hello World'`
* Double quotes  
  `greeting = "Hello World"`
* In some cases you may have to "escape" these characters to use them in a string.  
  `example = 'The boy said \'wow\''`
